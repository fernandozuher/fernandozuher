I am a researcher on Robotics who also enjoy languages and systematic reviews.

ðŸ”­ Currently, **NeuroðŸ§ roboticsðŸ¤–** is the topic that demands most of me: I am trying to understand how a humanoid robot works when it is controlled by a computer model based on a cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus spiking neuron network ðŸ§™ (what kind of witchcraft is this?). In a playful way:

A computer model based on a spiking neuron network of the Cortex, Basal Ganglia and Thalamus PLUS robot NAO:

I am investigating how such a robot works under both healthy and Parkisonian states of the neural network. That repository is private for potential Nobel prizes. I'm sorry =/

**But I can give you a beta subproduct of it**: I have refactored a plugin called "naoqi_webots" (originally "naoqisim").

It allows you to use the NAOqi SDK SoftBank Robotics into the simulated NAO robot of the Cyberbotics Webots.
    
How does it work? It connects the NAO robot simulated in Webots to the NAOqi process. Just that! 
    
*I have discussed this issue with Webots, RobotLAB and SoftBank Robotics in order to replace the outdated SDK used in it. Let's see... ðŸ¤”*

## âš½ Soccer humanoid robot framework
A soccer humanoid robot framework has been drafted in a too slow pace, I admit, but it lacks financial support from the government in my home country yet. A teaser can be taken in *** where there are a summary about the last competitors in SPL (Standard Plataform League) with some useful documentation about the best teams. It is summarized for you. Take for free with no guarantee (but mention this repository when taking advantage of that ;-)

## ComputerðŸ–¥ and HumanðŸ—£ Languages
I am an enthusiastic for computer/human languages!

<img align="left" width="900px" src="https://github.com/fernandozuher/fernandozuher/blob/master/images/programming.gif">
I have studied 5 programming and 2 markup languages in this Corona Age: C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, respectively.

You can checkout my homework in the Codility repository. Also my summaries and done exercises of reference-books in Algorithms-and-Programming repo.

As for the human languages, I speak Portuguese, English, Spanish. I can scrape together some Italian and French to get by. As for Arabic and Persian, I just pretend ;-)

All of those languages have been in my mind to be compared in a beautiful way. You can find an alpha repo about "comparator of languages" in AAA. 


## Robotic Tactile Sensing database
Last, but not least, I enjoy the information revealed in academic literature when it is brought by the process of systematic review. My Google Scholar/Scopus/Web of Knowledge site on Robotic Tactile Sensing has been cooked in a bain-marie in this repository: RTS.
