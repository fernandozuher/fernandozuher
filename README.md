I am a researcher on Robotics who also enjoy languages and systematic reviews.

ðŸ”­ Currently, **NeuroðŸ§ roboticsðŸ¤–** is the topic that demands most of me: I am trying to understand how a humanoid robot works when it is controlled by a computer model based on a cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus spiking neuron network ðŸ§™ (what kind of witchcraft is this?). In a playful way:

I am investigating how such a robot works under both healthy and Parkinsonian states of the neural network. That repository is private for potential Nobel prizes. I'm sorry =/

**But I can give you a beta subproduct of it**. I have refactored a plugin called "naoqi_webots" (originally "naoqisim"):

[<img height="50px" align="left" src="https://github.com/fernandozuher/fernandozuher/blob/master/images/naoqi_webots.png">](https://github.com/fernandozuher/naoqi_webots) It allows you to use the [NAOqi SDK SoftBank Robotics](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/nao6/downloads/nao6-downloads-linux) into the simulated NAO robot of the [Cyberbotics Webots](https://www.cyberbotics.com/). How does it work? It connects the NAO robot simulated in Webots to the NAOqi process. That's all!

*I have discussed this issue with Webots, RobotLAB and SoftBank Robotics in order to replace the outdated SDK used in it. Let's see... ðŸ¤”*

Besides, I have some parallel cool projects. They follow:

### âš½ Soccer humanoid robot framework
[<img height="50px" align="left" src="https://github.com/fernandozuher/fernandozuher/blob/master/images/soccer.png">](https://github.com/fernandozuher/humanoid_soccer) A humanoid robot soccer framework has been drafted in a too slow pace, I admit, but it lacks interest and financial support from the government in my home country. You can watch a teaser in its [repo](https://github.com/fernandozuher/humanoid_soccer), anyway.


### ComputerðŸ–¥ and HumanðŸ—£ Languages
I am an enthusiast of computer/human languages!

I have studied 5 programming and 2 markup languages in this Corona Age: C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, respectively.

[<img align="right" width="50px" src="https://github.com/fernandozuher/fernandozuher/blob/master/images/programming.gif">](https://github.com/fernandozuher/Codility)
You can check my homework in the Codility repository out. Also my summaries and realized exercises about reference-books in the [Algorithms-and-Programming](https://github.com/fernandozuher/Algorithms-and-Programming) repo.

As for the human languages, I speak Portuguese, English, Spanish. I can scrape together some Italian and French to get by. As for Arabic and Persian, I just pretend ðŸ˜¬

All of those languages have been in my mind to be compared in a beautiful way. You can find an initial draft repo about "comparator of languages" in [comparator_language](https://github.com/fernandozuher/comparator_language).

### Robotic Tactile Sensing database
Last, but not least, I enjoy the information revealed in academic literature when it is brought by the process of systematic review. My Google Scholar/Scopus/Web of Knowledge site on Robotic Tactile Sensing has been cooked in a bain-marie here [RTS](https://github.com/fernandozuher/RTS).
